## üöÄ Quick Help

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I get started?**
A: Follow the [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start) guide in the README. Make sure you have PortAudio installed and an OpenAI API key.

**Q: The wake word isn't being detected**
A: Try increasing the ambient noise calibration time with `--ambient-noise-duration 2.0` or use a different wake word with `--keyword "computer"`.

**Q: I'm getting PyAudio installation errors**
A: Install PortAudio first (see [Installing PortAudio](README.md#installing-portaudio)) and ensure you have the necessary build tools.

**Q: How can I contribute?**
A: Check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your development environment and submitting changes.

## üîß Self-Help Resources

### Debugging Tips
1. **Enable verbose logging**: `--log-level DEBUG`
2. **Test components individually**: Try just speech recognition or just OpenAI API
3. **Check environment variables**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
4. **Verify dependencies**: Run `uv run pytest` to check if everything is working

### Development Environment
- Use `uv` for dependency management (much faster than pip)
- Run tests with `uv run pytest -v`
- Format code with `uv run ruff format .`
- Check code quality with `uv run ruff check .`

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check if everything is working
uv run pytest -v

# Debug mode with verbose output
uv run voice-assistant --log-level DEBUG --once

# Test just the OpenAI integration
uv run python -c "from voice_assistant import VoiceAssistant; print('Import successful')"
```
